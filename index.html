                        Everybody loves ice cream. In fact, I have never met anyone who declined an invitation to a cone or cup of one. I am personally addicted to it that I often disregard its adverse effects on my throat and voice. In a tropical country like the Philippines, these frozen treats are non-negotiable especially during the summer months.

                        The Philippines is home to many exotic fruits that have found their way into the ice cream factories. It is not weird for the ice cream-eating populace to find what might otherwise be a strange flavor at a local convenience store. Take for example the mango-flavored ice cream. Mangoes thrive in tropical weather and in the Philippines, the best mangoes can be found in Guimaras. It therefore goes without saying that someone would come up with mango-flavored ice cream to ease the heat on a hot day.

                        Capuccino Ice Cream
                        <br> <br>
                        In comparison to a caf√© latte, the perfect cappuccino has a more intense coffee flavor, as well as a creamier mouthfeel due to more presence of air in the milk foam. Not far off from an espresso macchiato, the cappuccino maintains a strong coffee flavor with a more pronounced milky sweetness.
