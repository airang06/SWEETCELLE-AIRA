        <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
        <p class="text-center">
          Meow Cuddle Paradise is a non-profit organization dedicated to the
          rescue, rehabilitation and rehoming of abused and neglected animals.
          <br />
          <br />
          Meow Cuddle Paradise simply with a lot of hope, courage and the
          unwavering support of a few good friends. Our vision is a world where
          humans treat cats with respect, emphaty, and understanding. <br />
          <br />Meow Cuddle Paradise has been helping cats and their owners
          since 2024, evolving and adapting to changing social issues. These
          include converting the shelter into open rooms, not cages, for our
          cats to socialise in and developing our volunteering scheme to better
          support those with disabilities and special needs. Times change, but
          our love of cats remains consistent.

          <div class="box" style="text-align: right">
            Many of our Adoptables from other shelters have been rescued from
            death row, from local pounds or from abusive environments. By
            choosing to adopt, you are giving them the chance to fiend a new
            home and to feel the love and security they deserve.

          <p class="box">
            While not everyone can foster or adopt, there are always other ways
            to help our rescues. Through our Sponsor-A-Rescue Program, our
            rescues now have a wonderful support system rooting for their full
            recovery and continuous comfort while at the shelter.
