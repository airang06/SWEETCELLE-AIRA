        <h2>You Can Help</h2>
        <h3>DONATE</h3>
        <p>
          As a non-profit organization, Meow Cuddle Paradise operates and relies
          heavily on donations from the community. We are always called upon to
          rescue cats suffering from abandonment, abuse, injury or neglect and
          non of it is possible without your support.

        <h3>ADOPT</h3>
        <p>
          Many of our Adoptables from other shelters have been rescued from
          death row, from local pounds or from abusive environments. By choosing
          to adopt, you are giving them the chance to fiend a new home and to
          feel the love and security they deserve.

        <h2>SPONSOR</h2>
        <p>
          While not everyone can foster or adopt, there are always other ways to
          help our rescues. Through our Sponsor-A-Rescue Program, our rescues
          now have a wonderful support system rooting for their full recovery
          and continuous comfort while at the shelter.
